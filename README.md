# Deepfake Image Detection using StyleGAN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach to detect deepfake images generated using StyleGAN. It trains a classifier on real versus fake facial images and evaluates its performance on a labeled dataset.

##  Project Description

With the increasing realism of synthetic media, detecting AI-generated images has become critical. This project addresses the problem by using a supervised learning approach to distinguish real human faces from fake ones generated by StyleGAN. The model is trained and validated using a balanced dataset of real and fake face images.

##  Features

- Full end-to-end training pipeline in PyTorch
- Uses preprocessed dataset with 70k real and 70k fake face images
- High accuracy CNN-based classifier
- DataLoader, training loop, and evaluation metrics implemented
- Ready-to-run Jupyter notebook: `deepfake_model.ipynb`

##  Dataset

- **Real Faces**: From Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia
- **Fake Faces**: Generated by StyleGAN (1M fake faces dataset)

All images are resized to **256x256 pixels**. The dataset is pre-split into train, validation, and test sets.
